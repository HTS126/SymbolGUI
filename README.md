# SymbolGUI

SymbolGUI is a basic app designed to run in the bottom-right corner of a CS Student's screen, allowing them to quickly copy various symbols to their clipboard!

I have decided to make the code open source, so that anyone can either contribute to it, or modify it in their own way.

If you just want to use the software, you can either compile it yourself by cloning the repository, or you can download it straight from <a href="https://github.com/HTS126/SymbolGUI/blob/master/SymbolGUI/bin/Debug/SymbolGUI.exe">SymbolGUI > bin > Debug > SymbolGUI.exe</a>
